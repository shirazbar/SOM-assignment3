# Assignment 3 - Self Organizing Map
Authors: Shiraz Nave, Eden Meidan

Description: In this project, we used a type of artificial neural network called Self Organizing Map (SOM) in order to cluster cities according to their votes in the elections.

For execution you may use the "som.exe" file by clicking it.
When the program is running, please follow its instructions. 
You can use the existing 'Elec_24.csv' file, or specify another filename/path having the same data format. 

Output:
1. Plot of hexagon board of clusters, numbered according to their ID and colored according to 'economy' feature weight. 
2. Table describing the cities in each cluster

You can also run the program using the full code with the following commands:
>> pip install -r requirements.txt

>> python som.py
